# Assorter boxes and grids

The folder `src` contains the `openSCAD`-files to create different sized assorter boxes,
each subfolder contains the files for a more-or-less specific use-case.

The rendered `stl`-Files are contained in the folder `stl` grouped by use-case.

At this moment these pre-defined versions are contained:

- Base: Assortment boxes with 55x55x75mm for general use
- drawer:
  - boxes for small drawers with ~64x120mm size
  - mini: 30x30x33mm -> 2 by 4 boxes in each drawer
  - micro: 20x20x33mm -> 3 by 6 boxes in each drawer

## Todo:
* [ ] add pictures and more documentation to the Project
* [ ] add render script to create stl files for all predefined Setups
* [ ] Features for stapling?
* [ ] Features to cut big boxes into printable parts and to be glued together


## my dev environment
I use VisualStudio code with the [OpenSCAD-Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Antyos.openscad) to work with OpenSCAD.

## Notice
This code is quite messy as I am still learning how to properly use OpenSCAD. Some variable-names are not quite a got pick also.
I still want to publish this code in this state because I learned a lot from other peoples code.
If you have some recommendations/Ideas/Issues do not hesitate to write me a message or open an Issue/Pull-Request here.
I am happy to discuss and learn something new ;-D
